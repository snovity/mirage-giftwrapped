# Ember CLI Mirage Giftwrapped

Ember CLI Mirage is an awesome library, but it can't be used with pre-CLI
Ember apps. And sometimes that is
[exactly what you need](https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/issues/641)

This repo is a Ember CLI Mirage packaged together with its dependencies 
and ready for use in pre-CLI apps. Mirage was packaged using
[ember-giftwrap](https://github.com/ef4/ember-giftwrap) 

Confirmed to work with Ember 1.1.3
